You'll need to install python in order to run main.py, and you'll have to place GFT files in the gft folder.

If you want pictures to have white characters on a black background, open main.py and change WHITE to 0.

When changing glyphs to pictures, it will convert all pictures in the glyphs folder (including leftovers, if a new font hasn't overwritten old images.)
